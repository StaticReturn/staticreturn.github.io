### Friday Night Dungeon looks to accomplish the following:
* Fun, speedy combat.
* Roleplay focus.


### Compared to 5e:
* Remove turns where a character fails his action and thus does nothing.
* Better balanced combats.
* Combat should have risk, or at least be non-trivial.
* Combat consequence shouldn't just be how many HP you lose.
* Less dice rolling.
