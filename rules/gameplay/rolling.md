# Rolling
There are two types of rolls used to determin outcomes:  [Combat Rolls]({% link rules/gameplay/combat.md %}#combat-dice) & Challenge Rolls.


### Combat Rolls
Combat Rolls are rolls made to enhance your actions during combat or enable you to perform reactions.


### Challenge Rolls
Challenge Rolls are a roll that compares the character’s competence vs a challenge rating.   They are represented by rolling 2d6. Depending on your competence and the difficulty of the action you wish to perform you will be given a target number (TN).  If you roll below your TN you fail, if you roll exactly the TN you succeed but with a consequence, if you roll above the TN you succeed and if you roll double sixes you get a critical success.

You may not attempt a challenge roll with a difficulty that is more than one step above your competence.


| Ability Score | Skill Rank | Difficulty | Competence |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| \-2           | 0          | Trivial    | Unskilled  |
| \-1           | 1          | Easy       | Novice     |
| 0             | 2          | Moderate   | Trained    |
| +1            | 3          | Difficult  | Expert     |
| +2            | 4          | Heroic     | Master     |
| +3            | 5          | Legendary  | Legend     |


### Attempting a Challenge
The TN of a challenge is always 7.  If the difficulty is one step above or below your competence add or subtract 3 to the TN, as approrpiate.  If you are being aided add no more than one to your roll.  If you are being hindered, subtract 1 from your roll.

### Aiding and Hindering
If one or more characters add meaningful help to a challenge, the character is aided.  If one more characters hinder a challenge, he is hindered.  Do not add up sources of aid and hinderance if both are applied to a roll.  Any amount of aid and hinderance will negate all modifications to the dice result.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
When circumstance greatly affects the results of an outcome, roll with advantage or disadvantage.  Roll one extra die.  When rolling with advantage you may choose the two highest dice.  When rolling with disadvantage you must keep the two lowest dice.

### Rolling again, after a failed challenge
All physical challenges may be repeated as long as the character’s tools and stamina are up to the task.

If a character fails a mental challenge he may not attempt the same challenge again until he gains inspiration, a clue, or a sufficient amount of time passes that the character may be considered mentally refreshed.

Charm challenges may be repeated at the discretion of the dungeon master, who will judge the situation on a case-by-case basis.
