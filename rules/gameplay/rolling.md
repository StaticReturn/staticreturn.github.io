# Rolling
There are two types of rolls used to determin outcomes:  [Combat Rolls]({% link rules/gameplay/combat.md %}#combat-dice) & Challenge Rolls.


### Combat Rolls
Combat Rolls are rolls made to enhance your actions during combat or enable you to perform reactions.


### Challenge Rolls
Challenge Rolls are a method to determine if a character can perform a non-combat action.  Roll 2d6, add your Ability modifier or your skill modifier (+1 maximum), and compare is to the target number (TN). If you roll below your TN you fail, if you roll exactly the TN you succeed but with a consequence, if you roll above the TN you succeed and if you roll double sixes you get a critical success.


| Difficulty | TN            |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Easy       | 5             |
| Moderate   | 7             |
| Difficult  | 9             |
| Heroic     | 11            |
| Legendary  | 13            |


### Advantage and Disadvantage
When circumstance greatly affects the results of an outcome, roll with advantage or disadvantage.  When rolling with advantage add 1 to your result and when rolling with disadvantage subtract 1 from your result.

### Rolling again, after a failed challenge
All physical challenges may be repeated as long as the characterâ€™s tools and stamina are up to the task.

If a character fails a mental challenge he may not attempt the same challenge again until he gains inspiration, a clue, or a sufficient amount of time passes that the character may be considered mentally refreshed.

Charm challenges may be repeated at the discretion of the dungeon master, who will judge the situation on a case-by-case basis.
