# Health, Healing, Wounds

### Hit points
Hit points are an abstract representation of how combat ready a character is, in terms of bodily health and vigor.

### 0 hit points
When a character reaches 0 hit points he makes a Constitution challenge at easy difficulty, but receives a -1 to his roll for each wound he has.  If he fails he is dead.  If he succeeds he takes one wound, falls unconscious, and is considered dying.  If he does not receive aid within 3 rounds he will die from his wounds.  If he fails, he dies.

### Dying
If a dying character is dealt damage by a sentient source he will die.  If a character reaches four wounds, he dies.

### Wounds
Your wounds may be reduced by one by taking a safe rest.  For each wound you have all your challenge rolls have a -1 penalty and you may keep one less combat die up to a minimum of one.

### Partial Rest
You can rest for 10 minutes to regain half of your maximum hit points and mana.  You may only take up to three partial rests per day.

### Safe Rest
A character may only perform a safe rest if he is outside of danger and has twelve hours to spend relaxing, recuperating, and performing no taxing physical efforts.

A safe rest grants a character the following benefits: restore hit points to maximum, restore mana to maximum, restore all ability uses, remove the exhausted condition, and remove one wound if you did not remove the exhausted condition.

If a safe rest is interrupted treat the rest as a partial rest.
