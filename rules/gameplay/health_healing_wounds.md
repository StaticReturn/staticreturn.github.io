# Health, Healing, Wounds

### Hit points
Hit points are an abstract representation of how combat ready a character is, in terms of bodily health and vigor.

### 0 hit points
When a character reaches 0 hit points he makes a Constitution challenge at easy difficulty, but receives a -1 to his roll for each wound he has.  If he fails he is dead.  If he succeeds he takes one wound, falls unconscious, and is considered dying.  If he does not receive aid within 3 rounds he will die from his wounds.

### Dying
If a dying character is dealt damage by a sentient source he will die.  If a dying character takes damage from a non-sentient source he takes one wound.

### Wounds
Your wounds may be reduced by one by taking a safe rest.  If you gain four wounds you die.

| Wounds | Consequence                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Your maximum stamina is halved and your current stamina may not be greater than your maximum stamina.  You regain stamina at half the normal rate.                                |
| 2      | All of your challenge rolls receive a minus one and may not receive any bonuses.  The amount of damage you inflict in combat is reduced by one. You can no longer regain stamina. |
| 3      | All challenges are considered to be one difficulty greater and your level is considered to be one level lower for all combat considerations.                                      |

### Partial Rest
You can rest for 10 minutes to regain half of your maximum hit points and stamina.  They may only take up to three partial rests per day.

### Safe Rest
A character may only perform a safe rest if he is outside of danger and has twelve hours to spend relaxing, recuperating, and performing no taxing physical efforts.

A safe rest grants a character the following benefits: restore hit points to maximum, restore stamina to maximum, restore all ability uses, remove the exhausted condition, and remove one wound if you did not remove the exhausted condition.

If a safe rest is interrupted treat the rest as a partial rest.
