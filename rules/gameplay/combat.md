# Combat

### Combat Order
Each faction of a combat may decide the order in which each member participates.  The factions then take turns for their members to act, the player faction always going first.  If one side has more members than another, spread out the faction members as evenly as possible.

#### Surpise
If a faction is surprised the ambushing faction all get a chance to act before all others.

### Combat Dice
When you first start a game session, roll 3d6.  For every 1-2, you have rolled a shield.  For every 3-4, you have rolled a talent.  For every 5-6 you have rolled a sword.  At the end of your turn, roll again in this way.  Use these dice only to perform combat actions.

* ⚔ Are used for offensive actions.
* 🛡 Are used for defensive actions.
* ✧ Are used for all other combat actions or challenges.

Before you have rolled your next set of combat dice you may choose to "save" one die from your last roll.  You may then choose to replace any freshly rolled die with your saved die.

### Critical Success
When you roll three of the same value you have a **critical success**.  Until your next turn you may choose to make any action a **critical success**.  Critical successes double the damage, block all damage or upgrade the effect of your action.

### Combat Actions
You get three actions to perform between any of your turns. This may never be reduced below one, unless you are unconcious.

* Only one action may be used to attack during your turn.  This is refered to as your main attack.
* Any number of actions may be used to move.  Each move action gives you 20 feet of movement.
* Swap between a set of weapons.
* Throwing an item to hit a target.

All characters may spend combat dice to do the following:

* ⚔, ✧: Perform a called shot.
* ✧: Aid a challenge.
* ✧: Hinder a challenge.
* ✧: Move an ally 5 feet.
* 🛡: Reduce the damage of one attack by 1, targeted to you or an ally, and within melee range.
* 🛡: No attacks of opportunity may be performed against you until your next turn.


### Types of Actions
The action type should be infered by context.
* **Actions** happen during a character's turn.
* **Reactions** happen when it is not a character's turn and cost a combat die to perform.
    *  **Instants** happen just after a specific action happens.
    *  **Interrupts** happen just before a specific action happens.
*  **Free Actions** happen at any point in combat.  
    *  A character speaking.
    *  Getting one item from your inventory.
    *  Anything deemed a free action by your DM.

### Called Shots
A called shot is performed when a character wants to strike a specific spot on a target.  A ⚔ and ✧ combat die must be spent in order to perform this action.  The outcome is based on context.

### Information
The level, health, and armor of all participants in a combat are know to all.

### Damage
* Unarmed attack damage is 1
* Improvised weapon attack damage is 2
* Weapon and damage is 3

For every level your target has less than you, double your total damage against it.  For every level your target has more than you, half your total damage.  Damage is always round up.

Before level adjustments, no attack may receive more than 3 added damage and no defense may receive more than 3 damage reduction.  Critical successes break this rule.

* **Resistance**:  Reduce the damage by 1.
* **Vulernability**:  Increase the damage by 1.

### Two Weapon Fighting
If you are weilding two weapons, you may divide your damage between two valid opponents however you would like.

### Attacks of Opportunity
If an opponent leaves your threatened space you may spend an action and a ⚔ to deal attack damage to him.
