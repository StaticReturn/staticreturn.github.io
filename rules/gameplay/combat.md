# Combat


### Combat Order
Each faction of a combat may decide the order in which each member participates.  The factions then take turns for their members to act.  If one side has more members than another, spread out the faction members as evenly as possible.

#### Surpise
Unless surprised, the player faction will always begin the combat round first.  If a faction is surprise, the ambushing faction may have three of its members act before combat begins as normal.


### Combat Dice
When you first start a game session, roll 3d6.  For every 1-2, you have rolled a shield.  For every 3-4, you have rolled a talent.  For every 5-6 you have rolled a sword.  At the end of your turn, roll again in this way.  Use these dice to perform actions.

* âš” Are used for offensive actions.
* ðŸ›¡ Are used for defensive actions.
* âœ§ Are used for all other combat actions.

**Characters always roll 3d6**.  Nothing may change this.  However, certain conditions may change how many dice you keep until your next roll.

After you have rolled your combat dice you may choose to "save" one die from a previous roll and replace it with a die you just rolled.

### Critical Success
When you roll three of the same value you have a **critical success**.  Until your next turn, when you use one of your dice you may choose to make that action a **critical success**.  Critical successes double the damage, block all damage or upgrade the effect of your action.


### Combat Actions
You may only attack once during your turn and it does not require you to spend combat dice.  All characters may spend combat dice to do the following:

* âš” Add 1 damage to an attack.
* âš” âœ§ Perform a called shot.
* âœ§ Move 20 feet.
* âœ§ Aid an ally in a challenge.
* ðŸ›¡ Add 1 to your damage reduction to one attack.

If a character wishes to perform a creative action, use the following guideline:
* **1 die** - Something his race, bloodline, class, or profession are likely skilled in.
* **2 dice** - Something that would be difficult for him to perform.
* **3 dice** - Something epic.

### Types of Actions
The action type should be infered by context.
* **Actions** happen during a character's turn and cost a combat die to perform.
* **Reactions** happen when it is not a character's turn and cost a combat die to perform.
    *  **Instants** happen just after a specific action happens.
    *  **Interrupts** happen just before a specific action happens.
*  **Free Actions** happen at any point in combat.  
    *  A character speaking.
    *  Swapping once between your primary melee weapons and your primary ranged weapons.
    *  Getting one item from your inventory.
    *  Anything deemed a free action by your DM.


### Called Shots
A called shot is performed when a character wants to strike a specific spot on an target.  A âœ§ combat die must be spent in addition to the âš” die in order to perform this action.  The outcome is based on context.


### Information
The level, health, and armor of all participants in a combat are know to all.


### Damage
* Unarmed attack damage is 1
* Improvised weapon attack damage is 2
* Weapon and spell attack damage is 3

For every level your target has less than you, double your total damage against it.  For every level your target has more than you, half your total damage.  Damage is always round up.

Before level adjustments, no attack may receive more than 3 added damage and no defense may receive more than 3 damage reduction.  Critical successes break this rule.

* **Resistance**:  Reduce the damage by 1.
* **Vulernability**:  Increase the damage by 1.
