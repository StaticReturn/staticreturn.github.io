# Combat

### Combat Order
Each faction of a combat may decide the order in which each member participates.  The factions then take turns for their members to act, the player faction always going first.  If one side has more members than another, spread out the faction members as evenly as possible.

#### Surpise
If a faction is surprised the ambushing faction all get a chance to act before all others.

### Combat Dice
When you first start a game session, roll 3d6.  For every 1-2, you have rolled a shield.  For every 3-4, you have rolled a talent.  For every 5-6 you have rolled a sword.  At the end of your turn, roll again in this way.  Use these dice only to perform combat actions.

* âš” Are used for offensive actions.
* ðŸ›¡ Are used for defensive actions.
* âœ§ Are used for all other combat actions or challenges.

Before you roll your next set of combat dice you may choose to "save" one die from your last roll.  You may then choose to replace any freshly rolled die with your saved die.

### Critical Success
When you have three of the same value you have a **critical success**.  Until your next turn you may choose to make any action a **critical success**.  Critical successes double the damage, block all damage or upgrade the effect of your action.

### Combat Actions
You get three actions to perform between any of your turns. This may never be reduced below one, unless you are unconcious. Spend a combat die to perform a combat action.  You may spend any type of combat die to perform any action that does not require a specific combat die type.  For example your main attack.

Examples of combat actions that cost any type of combat die:

* Your main attack, which may only be used once during your turn.
* The move action gives you 20 feet of movement.
* Swap between a set of weapons.
* Throwing an item to hit a target.

Examples of combat actions that cost specific types of combat dice:

* âš”: Perform an attack of opportunity.
* âš”, âœ§: Perform a called shot.
* âœ§: Aid a challenge.
* âœ§: Hinder a challenge.
* âœ§: Move an ally 5 feet.
* ðŸ›¡: Reduce the damage of one attack by 1, targeted to you or an ally, and within melee range.
* ðŸ›¡: No attacks of opportunity may be performed against you until your next turn.


### Types of Actions
The action type should be infered by context.
* **Actions** happen during a character's turn.
* **Reactions** happen as a response to something occuring.
*  **Free Actions** happen at any point in combat.  
    *  A character speaking.
    *  Getting one item from your inventory.
    *  Anything deemed a free action by your DM.

### Called Shots
A called shot is performed when a character wants to strike a specific spot on a target.  A âš” and âœ§ combat die must be spent in order to perform this action.  The outcome is story based and does not grant extra damage.

### Information
The level, health, and armor of all participants in a combat are know to all.

### Damage
* Unarmed attack damage is 1
* Improvised weapon attack damage is 2
* Weapon damage is 3

For every level your target has less than you, double your total damage against it.  For every level your target has more than you, half your total damage.  Damage is always round up.

No attack may receive more than 3 added damage and no defense may receive more than 3 damage reduction.  Critical successes break this rule.

* **Resistance**:  Reduce the damage by 1.
* **Vulernability**:  Increase the damage by 1.

Critical Successes deal double damage after all modifiers.

### Two Weapon Fighting
If you are wielding two weapons, you may divide your damage between two valid opponents however you would like.

### Attacks of Opportunity
If an opponent leaves your threatened space you may spend a âš” to deal attack damage to him.

### Ranges
* **Melee**:  Within 5 feet.
* **Close**:  Within 10 feet.
* **Short**:  Within 30 feet.
* **Long**:  Within 90 feet.
* **Extended**:  Within 300 feet.
