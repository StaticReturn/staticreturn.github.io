# Combat


### Combat Order
Each faction of a combat may decide the order in which each member participates.  The factions then take turns for their members to act.  If one side has more members than another, spread out the faction members as evenly as possible.

#### Surpise
Unless surprised, the player faction will always begin the combat round first.  If a faction is surprise, the ambushing faction may have three of its members act before combat begins as normal.


### Combat Dice
When you first start a game session, roll 3d6.  For every 1-2, you have rolled a shield.  For every 3-4, you have rolled a talent.  For every 5-6 you have rolled a sword.  At the end of your turn, roll again in this way.  Use these dice to perform actions.

* âš” Are used for offensive actions.
* ðŸ›¡ Are used for defensive actions.
* âœ§ Are used for all other combat actions.

**Characters always roll 3d6**.  Nothing may change this.  However, certain conditions may change how many dice you keep until your next roll.

After you have rolled your combat dice you may choose to "save" one die from a previous roll and replace it with a die you just rolled.

When you roll three of the same value you have a **critical success**.  Until your next turn, when you use one of your dice you may choose to make that action a **critical success**.  Critical successes tripple the damage, block all damage or upgrade the effect of your action.


### Turns
During his turn, a character may do any of the following:

* âš” Attack one target and do 2 damage.  (once per turn)
* âš” âœ§ Perform a called shot. 
* âœ§ Move your movement speed.
* âœ§ Use one item.  (even if it is in a container)
* âš”, ðŸ›¡, or âœ§ Use an ability.

As a reaction, a character may do one of the following:

* ðŸ›¡ Reduce the damage taken by 1.
* âœ§ Aid an ally in a challenge.


### Information
The health and armor of all participants in a combat are know to all.

### Combat Actions
* **Actions** happen during a character's turn and cost a combat die to perform.
* **Reactions** happen when it is not a character's turn and cost a combat die to perform.
    *  **Instants** happen just after a specific action happens.
    *  **Interrupts** happen just before a specific action happens.
*  **Free Actions** happen at any point in combat.  This is usually a character speaking, but other actions may be demeed a free action by your DM.


### Called Shots
A called shot is performed when a character wants to strike a specific spot on an target.  A âœ§ combat die must be spent in addition to the âš” die in order to perform this action.  The consequence of a called shot on a foe is one extra damage or a condition.  Confirm your desired outcome before spending dice.
