* Strength

### Levels
There are five character levels.  Your race, bloodline, class, or profession may give you new abilities as you level up.  Levels are granted by the DM when you complate a story milestone.

### Hit Points
All characters start with 16 + 2*(Constitution) hit points.  This value can be modified by your race, bloodline, class, or profession.

### The Rule of 3
No effects may stack more than 3 times.  No more than 3 extra damage or damage reduction.  If there were to be a stack of 4 effects, they should be considered in order of time when applied.  (earliest give are applied)

Critical successes break this rule.  In this case you may **only** apply the results of a critical success to your results and may not receive effect stacks from any other source.
