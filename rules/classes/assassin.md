# Assassin
Strike from the shadows.

*  If you have partial cover it is considered full cover.
*  Treat all falls as if they were 10 feet less.
*  ⚔:  If you strike an opponent who hasn't seen you in combat, perform a critical hit.
*  ⚔:  If you started your turn with half or full cover, you gain 1 damage to all of your attacks.
*  ✧:  Climb up to 15 feet to a secure position.  You do not need to make a challenge roll while climbing for a difficulty equal or less than your competence.
