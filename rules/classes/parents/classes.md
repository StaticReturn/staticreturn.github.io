# Class
Your class describes how you fight, the system and style by which you approach combat.  There are three broad categories for fighting styles.

### Melee
These classes do best in the thick of combat.<br>
_Berzerker, Brawler, Duelist, Fighter, Marksman, Spell Sword, Swashbuckler_

### Strategist
These classes rely on movement, skill, and ability to affect combat.<br>
_Sniper, Assassin, Skirmisher, Tactician_

### Magic User
These classes rely on magic to solve problems.  From a distance.<br>
_Blood Mage, Elementalist, Runelord, Sorcerer, Timelord, Warlock, Wizard_

{: .development_note}
The abilities of a class should enable and reward play in alignment to the class.
**Example:**  A character chooses Berzerker because he wants to dive into the fray.  Enable and reward that.
