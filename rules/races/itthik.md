# Itthik
A form of minor elemental that closely resemble humans.  You may choose your Human likedness, but are functionally the same as a Human.

* **Choose** an element form: Water, Earth, Fire, Air, and Void.
* Immune to natural damage of your affinity.
* Resistance to magical damage of your affinity.

Void is not well understood.  It has aspects of potential, dissolution, space, gravity, and time.  It is also very dangerous, consuming or corrupting mortals that attempt to harness its power.



<!-- When attempting to use an element that is adjacent to your own, like lava, the challenge rating is increased by 1 and the stamina cost is doubled.

### Abilties
For challenges it will cost 5 + \(difficulty level\) - \(character level\) stamina to use for the duration of one round.

What can you do?  Anything you can think of.  But remember to consult your DM.  You can create some of your element, you can move it, coat your weapon in it, move through your element. -->
